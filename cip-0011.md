## Abstract

Save 3 bytes of space in every transaction by shortening the number of bytes allocated to the message type ID from 4 bytes to 1 byte.

* Applies to all transaction types
* Remains backward compatible
* Allows for extension


## Motivation

Each Counterparty message allocates 4 bytes to the message type ID.  But Counterparty only uses 14 of the 4 billion possible message types.  We should shorten the message type ID to 1 byte.  This will save 3 bytes in every transaction.


## Rationale

All used message type IDs require a single byte.  We will only read 1 byte instead of 4 bytes as the message type ID.

If the type ID is 0 (`0x00`) then 4 bytes will be read.  See [Backwards Compatibility](#backwards-compatability).


## Example

**Before**

```
434e545250525459|00000001|000000000004fadf000000174876e800000000000000000000000000
       |             |          |
       |             |          └── Message specific data (variable number of bytes)
       |             └──────────────── This is the transaction type identifier (4 bytes)
       └───────────────────────────────── The string CNTRPRTY in hexadecimal (8 bytes)
```

**After**

```
434e545250525459|01|000000000004fadf000000174876e800000000000000000000000000
       |          |        |
       |          |        └── Message specific data (variable number of bytes)
       |          └────────────── This is the transaction type identifier (1 bytes)
       └──────────────────────────── The string CNTRPRTY in hexadecimal (8 bytes)
```


## Backwards Compatibility

If the first byte of the type ID is 0 (`0x00`), then 4 bytes will be read as the message type ID.

Standard send messages have a type ID of 0, so they will not be able to take advantage of the new, short transaction type ID.  Standard send messages must still use a 4-byte type ID of `0x00000000`.  Enhanced sends are the successor to the standard send message and are expected to form the majority of the send transaction traffic.

Keeping the 4 byte message type as an option ensures backward compatibility with alternate clients that form Counterparty transactions.  It also provides a simple means for the future expansion to more than 255 message type IDs.

This is a consensus change that will require all users running Counterparty software to upgrade by a certain block to be chosen after implementation is complete.
