# Abstract

This is a proposal to support spending and creating segwit outputs for Counterparty transactions

* Modify counterparty-lib to generate P2WPKH or P2WSH outputs
* Modify counterparty-lib to parse P2WPKH or P2WSH outputs
* Modify counterparty-lib to interpret Bech32 (BIP 173) addresses in API methods in order to form the right type of output
* Modify counterwallet to display Bech32-formatted addresses in addition to the base58 addresses


# Motivation

Neither counterparty-lib nor counterwallet are segwit aware.  Transactions are constructed using standard P2PKH scripts.

By utilizing P2WPKH scripts to send assets, users can spend less on transaction fees sent from counterparty-lib and counterwallet.  Adding segwit compatibility to counterparty-lib also enables potential future enhancements.


# Rationale

### Segwit Implementation for Public Key Hash addresses (1xxxx style addresses)

When paying or sending change to a public key hash (a 1xxxx style address on mainnet), segwit can be enabled in one of two ways:

1. P2WPKH output scripts
2. Embedding a P2WPKH script inside a P2SH script, or P2SH(P2WPKH)

Using P2WPKH output scripts would remain compatible with the standard 1xxxx address types that counterwallet currently uses.  By using P2WPKH scripts, we only require a relatively minor upgrade to counterwallet and counterparty-lib.

Using P2SH(P2WPKH) outputs would require a significantly more complex update to counterwallet.

Since a large percentage of addresses that hold Counterparty assets are used exclusively by counterparty-lib and counterwallet we will use P2WPK output scripts.


### Segwit Implementation for Pay to Script Hash addresses (3xxxx or "multisig" style addresses)

When sending an output to a standard 20-byte script hash (a 3xxxx style address on mainnet), counterparty-lib will generate standard P2SH outputs.

If, however, the recipient address is a 32 byte script hash, counterparty-lib will generate a P2WSH output as these addresses are compatible with segwit outputs only.

Note that enhanced sends do not support sending assets to a 32 byte script hash.  All sends to a 32 byte script hash will use the legacy send method that includes a destination output with bitcoin dust.


### Support for 32 byte P2SH addresses

Counterparty will be able to receive and send assets to and from 32 byte script hash addresses.  These are segwit compatible multisig addresses.  These will be referenced by their 62 character Bech32 address.


# Specification


### API Changes

Counterparty APIs will accept Bech32 encoded addresses as input arguments and will continue to support base58-encoded addresses.

Counterparty APIs will return base58 encoded addresses for all API calls with the exception of operations involving 32 byte segwit P2WSH addresses.  P2WSH addresses will be returned in 62 character Bech32 format.



### counterwallet

For this CIP, counterwallet will be modified to show the Bech32 version of each address in smaller text next to the standard Base58 address.

The Base58 encoding will become less prominent and be hidden by default in the future.  But that is outside the scope of this CIP implementation.


### Sending BTC

When generating a transaction that sends BTC to the recipient, counterparty-lib will generate the transaction outputs based on the format of the destination address.

- If the recipient address is a Base58 encoded P2PKH (1xxxx) address, then a standard P2PKH output will be generated.
- If the recipient address is a Base58 encoded P2SH (3xxxx) address, then a standard P2SH output will be generated.
- If the recipient address is a Bech32 encoded P2WPKH (bc1xxxx) address, then a segwit P2WPKH output will be generated.
- If the recipient address is a Bech32 encoded P2WSH (bc1xxxxxxx) address, then a segwit P2WSH output will be generated.


### Bitcoin Core v0.13.2

We will continue to use the addrindex-0.13.2 version of bitcoind at this time.  The addrindex patch will continue to work as expected.



### Transaction Parsing by counterparty-lib

Counterparty server will parse P2WPKH outputs in addition to P2PKH outputs.



# Backwards Compatibility

Segwit support will be a consensus change that will activate at a specific block to be determined after implementation.  All parsing servers will need to upgrade before this block to maintain consensus.
