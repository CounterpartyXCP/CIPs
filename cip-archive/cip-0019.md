## Deprecation notice ##

Indexd has been deprecated from the tech stack in favor of addrindexrs on cip22.

## Abstract ##

Codebase maintenance is part of the continuous effort necessary to make
Counterparty an attractive choice for the community in general. This CIP
presents the necessary steps to get XCP codebase up to date with the latest
Bitcoin technology to take advantage of the latest developments in the space.

## Motivation ##

Current Counterparty deployments are based around an unmaintained bitcoin fork
which has aged well, but lacks the latest bugfixes, support for the latest
features (like segwit, hash timelocked contracts, bech32 address encoding and
so on) and any active developer. This CIP proposes continuation of the previous
code maintainer (Devon Weller) to finish bringing support for the latest and
best supported codebases.

## Rationale ##

Latest Bitcoin improvements since the current supported version (0.13) are
obvious advantages for Counterparty to benefit from:

 * Faster blockchain sync and parsing
 * Segwit support for lower fees
 * Hash Timelocked Contracts (HTLCs) which enable atomic swaps and lightning
 * Better fee estimation

These changes alone, without XCP's codebase support, are already a big win over
the current supported Bitcoin daemon.

However, the most pressing matter is the fact that the codebase of the Bitcoin
daemon that Counterparty supports is unmaintained in favor of more elegant and
clean solutions. This is a critical issue that needs a quick solution, as the
community risks any 0-day bug to totally halt counterparty functioning without
proper code maintenance.

## Technical Implementation ##

Current state of the implementation is the following:

 * Indexd server syncs up correctly, but lag sometimes behind tip. This issue
   will prevent users from using UTXOs from the last confirmed block.
 * There are some incompatibilities between 0.15 (which was the original indexd
   update target) and 0.16, especially regarding fee estimation. There's an
   already open PR to solve this issue that needs merging.
 * Address generation config must be changed by default temporarily while the
   development team introduces support for bech32 addresses.
 * Fednode deployment testing on the indexd branch needs to be done.

Indexd needs completion of bugfixes, fednode with indexd needs adjusting and
proper testing and a new Counterparty release should be done (9.56.0).

Another important task is to finish merging/rejecting all the accepted,
nonsensical and/or minor PRs on the different Counterparty repos. The following

inspection:
