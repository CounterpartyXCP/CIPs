## Abstract ##

Counterparty has been receiving multiple fixes and enhancements, and one of the
CIPs that's being worked on includes SegWit support for the platform. However,
when the time comes adoption of SegWit enabled addresses could take some time
to catch on because there's no easy way to move all the tokens from one legacy
address to a new SegWit address. The "address sweep" message solves this by
sending all the assets owned and ownerships to a target address in one single
operation.

## Motivation ##

SegWit adoption has proven to reduce the burden of on-chain transactions by a
huge factor on the main chain, and as users of the "commons" we must set forth
an example of "good citizenship" on the usage of the limited resource that is
blockchain storage. Using and promoting SegWit addresses and any other new
technology that pops up in the future with the intent to lower blockchain space
usage pressure would not only prove to be a winning move for lower fees, but it
will also show to the main core detractors that we're well behaved inside the
parent blockchain. When we add support for SegWit, we will need a fast migration
path for users that has a low barrier of adoption.

## Rationale ##

Moving assets and ownerships between addresses in large batches has been
cumbersome and costly in the past due to how Counterparty addresses are encoded.

However, there's one specific case where a whole address needs to move all its
assets and ownerships to another address, be it due to migration of technology,
wallet compromise or OTC selling of its contents.

## Technical implementation ##

A new message type under the CIP11 numbering should be allocated for address
sweep messages.

The address sweep must specify the following fields:

  * New Message ID: ````0x03````
  * Receiving address (should have SegWit compatible encoding, 21 bytes script)
  * An 8-bit mask specifying what should be transferred and how:
    - 0x01 : Asset balances
    - 0x02 : Asset ownership
    - 0x03 : Memo is hex
  * Memo field (Rest of the remaining message)

Address sweep will require an anti-spam fee of 0.05 XCP that will be deducted
from the sending address.

# API Changes

### create_sweep

`create_sweep` creates a sweep message:

 * **destination** : The address receiving the assets and/or ownerships.
 * **ops**: 8-bit mask of the operations to be done

### get_sweeps

gets the sweeps from the database, in the same manner as other get_* ops.
