Abstract
-------------

Proposal to include taproot addresses in the creation and parsing of counterparty transactions


Motivation
-------------

Taproot is the last major upgrade in bitcoin since segwit, offering batching of multiple signatures which improve scalability and privacy. 

By January 2023 its popularity increased and Counterparty is not compatible with these kind of addresses yet, meaning that there are many taproot addresses holding bitcoins that could be potentially used on the platform to create, dispense and exchange tokens.



Specification
-------------

### Libraries compatibility

Counterparty uses python-bitcoinlib for bitcoin operations and by the time this CIP was written it hasn't been updated with taproot protocol, so some changes need to be made to this library to encode and decode the bech32m address format

There will be a new url in counterparty-lib DOCKERFILE to download python-bitcoinlib with new changes, hopefully this will be temporary while the official update for taproot is awaited.


### Parsing taproot addresses

Once python-bitcoinlib gets updated then all segwit parsing functions must be updated as well to distinguish between segwit version 0 (segwit) or segwit version 1 (taproot) and, in taproot case, detect p2tr transactions.


### Serializer

It's neccesary to add p2tr serialization for taproot addresses


### Dispensers, enhanced sends and sweeps

The format of the dispensers message data needs to take into account that the taproot addresses are longer, right now only accepts opening dispensers on new addresses (opening a dispenser in an address different than the transaction source) using legacy or segwit. The same happens with the oracle_address.

Enhanced sends and sweeps pack the destination address on the transaction data. Because this data is shared with the memo, when this destination uses a taproot address, the memo must be 12 bytes less in size than with other types of addresses




Parsing Activation Block
-------------

There is going to be an activation block where all nodes will start parsing transactions with taproot addresses


Milestones
-------------

#### Milestone #1
Make python-bitcoinlib changes to support bech32m encode and decode

#### Milestone #2
Enable parsing of transactions with taproot addresses 

#### Milestone #3
Add p2tr serializations to create transactions with taproot addresses

#### Milestone #4
Adapt dispensers, enhanced sends and sweeps to use taproot addresses
