# Abstract
Enable linking of a `file` to an `asset` via a `stamp`.

# Motivation
Define a process for encoding a `file` into a transaction and associating the `file` with an `asset` via an `issuance`.

# Rationale
The [`Bitcoin Stamps`](https://github.com/mikeinspace/stamps/blob/main/BitcoinStamps.md) spec  first proposed the basic guidelines for how to create a `stamp`, as well as additional guidelines for the [`Bitcoin Stamps`](https://stampchain.io) project.

This CIP has been created to clarify the technical process to `stamp` a `file` to any `asset`, and remove any project-specific requirements from the protocol.

# Definitions

- `stamp` -  Any `issuance` transaction with the `stamp:` prefix in the `description` field
- `file` - Any file type 
- `asset` - Any asset type (numeric, named, subassets)
- `mime-type` - Any of the currently defined MIME / Media Types according to the [IANA Spec](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)

# Specification
Any `issuance` will be considered a `stamp` if the `description` field begins with the prefix `stamp:` (case-insensitive). This ensures a stable numbering system for stamps and allows for expansion of the protocol in the future to support additional encoding formats.

The `stamp:` prefix should immediately be followed by `file` data in one of the following formats:
- `base64_data`
- `mime-type:base64_data`
- `data:mime-type;base64,base64_data`

Multiple files can be encoded in a single `stamp` transaction by specifying a `;` character to separate the files, followed by one of the above formats. 

Single `file` example:

- `stamp:iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU...`
- `stamp:image/png;iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU...`
- `stamp:data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU...`

Multiple `file` Example:

- `stamp:iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU...;iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU...`
- `stamp:image/png;iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU...;image/png;iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU...`
- `stamp:data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU...;image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU...`
