# Abstract
Support encoding a `file` in a counterparty transaction 

# Motivation
Provide a way for users to associate a chunk of data or a file with a Counterparty issuance or broadcast transaction.

# Rationale
The popularity of blockchain `file` encoding protocols such as [`Inscriptions`](https://ordinals.com/inscriptions) and [`Bitcoin Stamps`](https://stampchain.io/) indicates users want to store `file` data on a highly-available and permanent medium. 

Counterparty currently stores `file` data in the internal database, which is adding bloat and slowing down queries.

This CIP has been created to standardize the way that Counterparty deals with a `file`, allow specifying a `mime-type` for a `file`, and to migrate `file` data out of the database.

# Definitions
- `file` - Any file type 
- `mime-type` - Any of the currently defined MIME / Media Types according to the [IANA Spec](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)

# Specification
The following modifications are needed to support this CIP.

## Issuances
- Add `data_type` param to `create_issuance` API (default: null)
- Add `data_type` field to `issuances` table
- Add new issuance data format with `data_type` field (id=24)
- Store `data_type` info in `data_type` field in `issuances` table
- Store `description` info in `description` field if `data_type` is `null` or `plain/text` (up to 1024 characters)

## Broadcasts
- Add `data_type` param to `create_broadcast` API (default: null)
- Add `data_type` field to `broadcasts` table
- Add new broadcast data format with `data_type` field (id=31)
- Store `data_type` info in `data_type` field in `broadcasts` table
- Store `text` info in `text` field if `data_type` is `null` or `plain/text` (up to 1024 characters)

## `get_{table}` API 
- Add `db_data` param (default: `true`)
- Set `limit` to `100` when `db_data` param is `false` (limits abuse on bitcoind)
- `get_broadcasts`
    - Return `text` field from raw tx data (bitcoind) when `db_data` param is `false`
- `get_issuances`
    - Return `description` field from raw tx data (bitcoind) when `db_data` param is `false`
