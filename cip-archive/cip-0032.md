## Abstract

Reserve a dispenser for 10 blocks by sending a tiny amount of BTC dust to it.

- This is optional. Dispensers can be used without reservation as before.
- Backwards compatible. No changes to how dispensers are set up.

## Motivation

When a buyer sends bitcoin to a dispenser, there is no guarantee that the dispense gets executed. Several factors can lead to a dispense failing, including random and malicious ones. Currently, one should only buy from a dispenser if the amount is trivial or the seller is trusted to reverse a failed transaction.

Dispensers have increasingly been used beyond the designed scope. Whether this is due to convenience or ignorance, significant losses have occurred. Moreover, hackers have set up so-called "rugspensers" that automatically steal the buyers' bitcoins.

Allowing for the reservation of a dispenser will make dispensers safe for any amount of value.

## Details

The new rules added to the dispenser consensus code:

- If a an incoming BTC transaction is smaller than one dispenser lot but at least 5,000 sats (₿0.00005, currently ~$1.35), then the protocol reserves this one lot for 10 blocks. (Previously this transaction would have been ignored.)

- If the buyer pays the full amount within the 10 block deadline, the tokens get dispensed.

- If the buyer does not pay within the deadline, the reserved block is released back to the dispenser and available to anyone again.

## Examples

A) A dispenser for TOKENA is listed for ₿0.01. Alice buys this token directly without reservation. The hassle of dealing with a reservation is not worth it since the amount is so small.

B) A dispenser for TOKENB is listed for ₿0.1. Bob wants to buy this token but is not confident that the seller will refund him in case something goes wrong. He therefore firsts sends a dust amount of 5,000 sats. Once it confirms, he waits 3 blocks to be absolutely sure and proceeds with paying the remaining ₿0.09995.

C) An XCP dispenser is listed at ₿0.0002 per XCP. Charlie suspects this might be a rugspenser. But since he can only reserve one lot (ie one XCP) it is not worth it. He rather looks for a dispenser where XCP is bundled in larger lots, like ₿0.02 for 100 XCP, where it makes sense to make a reservation.

D) Dave messed up the decimals. Instead of paying ₿0.12345678, his wallet rounded down by one satoshi. A reservation was automatically made, so all Dave had to do was send a dust amount to trigger the dispense.
