## Abstract ##

With chaining 2 transactions together we can embed data in the scriptSigs of P2SH outputs.


## Motivation ##

Counterparty currently has the following data encoding schemes:
 - `opreturn` the best solution, doesn't pollute the UTXO set, is the cheapest, but limited to a maximum 80 bytes
 - `multisig` the 2nd best solution, only temporarly pollutes the UTXO set, has no upper limit
 - `pubkeyhash` the worst solution, permanently pollutes the UTXO set, but also has no upper limit

For (literally) 99% of Counterparty transactions `opreturn` is enough (though some people forcefully use multisig encoding).
Previously for the rest we'd fall back to using `multisig` encoding since it has no real drawbacks.

In Bitcoin Core v0.12.1 there was a DoS protection (called `bytespersigop`) that essentially made bare multisig non-standard.  Bare multisig is discouraged by Bitcoin Core developers and may likely be limited or removed in a future Bitcoin Core release.

So we need an alternative for larger amounts of data and we want to avoid `pubkeyhash` encoding because it pollutes the UTXO set too much.

## Rationale ##

It's possible to embed data in P2SH redeemScripts by doing 2 transactions
where the first one sets up P2SH outputs with redeemScripts that allow us to put the data in the scriptSig of the spending transaction.

With this method we can easily put in a lot more data than the other methods.  This does not polute the UTXO set
and signature data can be pruned by Bitcoin nodes that wish to do so.

The original proof of concept, by Peter Todd, of this can be found here: https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib/blob/master/examples/publish-text.py


## Specification ##

### The Basics
This process requires 2 transactions, the first to setup 1 or more P2SH outputs and then the second spending the P2SH outputs and placing the data we wish to embed in the `scriptSig`.

##### The Redeem Script
The data is split into chunks of max 520 size, then for each chunk we create a `redeemScript` as follows:

```
redeemScript = {{ data }} OP_DROP {{ pubkey }} OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY {{ n }} OP_DROP OP_DEPTH 0 OP_EQUAL
```

dissecting this into pieces we have:

```
{{ data }}
```
this is the counterparty operation data.  Since this data is part of the redeemScript it is included in the hash of the P2SH address.

```
{{ pubkey }} OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY
```
this ensures the output needs to be signed by the owner. Any arbitrary script operation is allowed here as well.

```
{{ n }} OP_DROP
```
`n` is an incrementing number to ensure that each output is unique even when the data chunks aren't.


```
OP_DEPTH 0 OP_EQUAL
```
this prevents scriptSig malleability.

##### The Output Script
The output script placed in the first transaction is then:
```
ouputScript = OP_HASH160 {{ hash160([redeemScript]) }} OP_EQUALVERIFY
```

### The real deal
Below we'll describe how a Counterparty `send` would look.

##### Transaction 1

###### Inputs
 - 1 + n UTXOs from any address with enough BTC to pay the fees for both the first and the second transaction.

###### Outputs
 - 1 + n P2SH outputs following the above method with at least `DUST` value.  The sum of these outputs must contain enough value to pay the fees for the second transaction.
 - 1 change output to send any excess BTC to the sender or a new change address.  This is optional.

##### Transaction 2

###### Inputs
 - 1 input spending a source output from the `source`.  (This is optional.  It can be used for defining a source address when sending from a P2SH address.  See below.)
 - 1 + n inputs spending the P2SH data outputs.  The transaction data is included in the `scriptSig`

###### Outputs
 - 1 output to specify the destination of the Counterparty transaction with `DUST` value if needed.  In most transactions this can be omitted.
 - 1 `OP_RETURN` output encoding the data `'CNTRPTY' + 'P2SH'` to signal that the data is found in the P2SH inputs, with 0 value.
 - 1 change output to any address.  This is optional.


###### Fees & Coin Selection
The first transaction has to send enough BTC to the second transaction so the second transaction can pay for it's own fee without having to add extra inputs.
So we calculate the value of the output in the first transaction to be:
```
estimated_size_of_tx2 = 10  # base size of  TX
estimated_size_of_tx2 += 181  # for source input
estimated_size_of_tx2 += sizeof(data)  # for the data
estimated_size_of_tx2 += count(data_p2sh_outputs) * (181 + 9)  # for the overhead of each data output being spend
estimated_fee_for_tx2 = (estimated_size_of_tx2 / 1000) * fee_per_kb
```

This means the amount of BTC to require when doing coin selection is:
```
estimated_size_of_tx1_without_inputs = 10  # base size of a TX
estimated_size_of_tx1_without_inputs += count(data_p2sh_outputs) * 29  # for P2SH data outputs

inputs = []
for UTXO in coinselection:
   inputs.append(UTXO)
   estimated_size_of_tx1 = estimated_size_of_tx1_without_inputs + count(inputs) * 181
   estimated_fee_for_tx1 = (estimated_size_of_tx1 / 1000) * fee_per_kb

   if sum(inputs) >= estimated_fee_for_tx1 + estimated_fee_for_tx2:
       break
```


### Determining the source address

If the redeem script contains `{{ pubkey }} OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY`, then the source address will be constructed from the pubkey provided in the redeem script.

When the source address is a P2SH address, the redeem script will not contain any pubkey.  In this case, the source address will be determined by the first input.  If transaction 2 spends an input from a P2SH script and there is no `{{ pubkey }} OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` in the redeem script, then the source address will be the P2SH address that provided the first input spent in transaction 2.

### The Counterparty API
In practice this means the `create_*` API calls will have to start returning a list of 1 or more transactions which the client signs and broadcasts,
so clients need to adapt to this new style and always assume they need to sign and broadcast N transactions.

Pre-segwit we won't be able to have the second transaction spend from the first transaction until the first transaction has been signed,
this means the client actually needs to do 2 API calls, where the second has the txId of the signed first transaction as a parameter.

Once we can use segwit this problem is gone! However not all clients will straight away be able to sign segwit transactions (requires upgrades of the libraries they use).

Because of this being quite a hassle we propose to have 2 configuration and API parameters to control all of this: `segwit` and `old_style_api`.

##### `old_style_api`
When `old_style_api = True` the API will continue to function as normal, returning a single transaction, as string.

Once `old_style_api = False` the API will (across all `create_*` transactions) return a list of 1+ transactions (even when it's just 1).

While `old_style_api = True` P2SH encoding will not be used unless explcitily set (so - the default - `encoding=auto` will not use P2SH encoding).

##### `segwit`
When `segwit = False` the first API call will return `[tx_hex, None]` signalling that it needs a second call with `p2sh_pretx_txid` added as param,
which should be the txId of the signed first transaction.
The second API call will then return `[None, tx_hex]`.

When `segwit = True` the API call will return `[tx_hex, tx_hex]` and will no longer require a second API call.


### Child pays for Parent
The current scheme ensures both transactions pay fee for their own size, in the (near) future when the 'Child pays for Parent' functionality
that has been added to Bitcoin Core is widely adopted we can change this so that the second transaction pays a larger portion of the total fee (still needs to pay enough to be relayed).

This will ensure that the first transaction is never mined without the second transaction.


## Backwards Compatibility ##

This is a new encoding that will be completely unrecognised by older clients, any clients who don't upgrade would loose consensus with the nodes that did upgrade.
It also affects how the Counterparty API works (see above).
