## Abstract ##

Have a betting feed with relevant Bitcoin and Counterparty data. 

This opens up for managing risks, as well as for speculation.

This utilizes the existing betting system. Minor protocol changes are required.

## Motivation ##

Counterparty's original vision began with: `Counterparty is an innovative peer-to-peer financial platform. Unlike Wall Street and other centralized financial institutions, Counterparty provides open, secure financial tools and markets that do not require a trusted third party or middleman to use.`

Those who participated in the initial burn expected XCP to be used in financial contracts, of which the betting system played a central part.

One essential piece of the puzzle has yet to be implemented. Betting feeds still require a trusted third party. This proposal will integrate an oracle in the protocol, eliminating the need for a trusted middleman (for data derived from the blockchain).

The automated oracle will periodically broadcast values that have real economic impact on users of Counterparty and Bitcoin. This includes the fee level and the XCP/BTC price. In addition it's trivial to add a random number feed which will enable betting on any probability, and potentially be used for future smart contracts.  

## Rationale ##

The oracle will start broadcasting values every 130 blocks (normally between 21 and 22 hours). On this block it will broadcast the first value, on the following block the second value, and so on.

The first value it broadcasts reveals the current fee level. For each of the previous ten blocks, the oracle takes the coinbase transaction amount minus the block reward. and divides this by the block size. From these ten values, it broadcasts the median. Businesses which are hurt by large fees can use this to insure against some of the impact.

The second value is the XCP/BTC price from the DEX. The latest traded value is broadcast. Although there is not much BTC trading going on on the DEX at the moment, opening up for XCP/BTC derivatives, will open up for third party market makers to develop improved infrastructure.

The third value is a uniform random decimal between 0 and 1. It's derived from the latest block hash, and it's very close to a true random number. A theortical miner withholding attack is only ecomonically viable if very large amounts are at stake, and even then the impact is limited. 

The oracle makes its broadcasts from an address with no private key (burn address) by simulating a real Counterparty transaction.

To take full advantage of these feeds, bets must be matched by `greater / not-greater`. Currently only `equal / not-equal` matching is possible. New bet types are needed. 

## Technical Implementation ##

The oracle will use a burn address - `1oRACLExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxy1rU5Gf` - the address is valid, yet has no private key.
At every block Counterparty will check `feed_cycle = block_height MOD 130`.

`If feed_cycle = 0` broadcast fee level.
`If feed_cycle = 1` broadcast XCP/BTC price.
`If feed_cycle = 2` broadcast random number.

Broadcast will carry parameters `source`, `fee_fraction`, `text`, `timestamp`, `value`.

The constant ones are `source = 1oRACLExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxy1rU5Gf` and `fee_fraction = 0`.

`text =` `Fee Ratio (sat/b)`, `XCP/BTC Price (sat)` or `Random (0-1)`.

The `timestamp` will be set to the current `block_height`.

The broadcast will be added to the DB as the first transaction of the current block.

## Additional Comments ##

The bet send format requires a few pennies worth of BTC dust to be sent to the oracle. It will get burned since the address has no private key. An updated send format where the oracle is encoded in the message itself, will solve this. 

More values can be added, or existing one removed, later. This requires a protocol change. Dynamic adding and removing of feeds are possible, but beyond the scope of this CIP.

Unmatched bets expire after a user-defined amount of blocks. Ideally the protocol will give an option to set expiry at a certain block height.

Counterparty bets have binomial payouts. CFDs used to be available but were disabled due to a bug, combined with the belief that smart contracts were coming. CFDs can be fixed and re-enabled later.

## Milestones ##

A 0.62 BTC+BCH bounty has been donated.
Additional donations in BTC, BCH and XCP can be made to the following address (escrow by J-Dog): ___________

* 70% of BTC and 70% of XCP is paid out with a working implementation demonstrated on testnet. This included placing bets on the feed.

* All remaining BTC, BCH and XCP is paid out when merged to master on mainnet.
