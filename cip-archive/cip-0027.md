# Abstract
Mirror `stamp` `file` data to a local filesystem

# Motivation
Migrate `stamp` `file` data out of the counterparty database and provide a `stamp` `file` mirroring solution.

# Rationale
The popularity of blockchain `file` encoding protocols such as [`Inscriptions`](https://ordinals.com/inscriptions) and [`Bitcoin Stamps`](https://stampchain.io/) indicates users want to store `file` data on a highly-available and permanent medium. 

Currently `stamp` `file` data is stored in the `description` field in both the `issuances` and `messages` database tables in [`counterparty-lib`](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterparty-lib). Storing this data in multiple tables is unnecessary, is bloating the database, and will have a long-term performance impact as we support stamping larger files, and multiple files in the same transaction.

Writing `stamp` `file` data to files on a local filesystem allows for removal of the data from database tables, which helps ensure that the database stays as small and fast as possible.

Updating the Counterparty fednode stack to serve out `stamp` `file` data from a local filesystem, effectively makes every Counterparty node a `stamp` `file` mirror, 

The `STAMP Filesystem` proposal further ensures the availablity of `stamp` `file` data by making it not only available on the Bitcoin blockchain, but also on every Counterparty node.

# Definitions

- `stamp` -  Any `issuance` transaction with the `stamp:` prefix in the `description` field
- `file` - Any file type 
- `mime-type` - Any of the currently defined MIME / Media Types according to the [IANA Spec](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)

# Specification
The following modifications are needed to support this CIP.

1. When parsing an issuance with a `stamp:` prefix :
    - remove `stamp:` prefix
    - Parse `stamp` `file` data according to the [`STAMP Protocol`](./cip-0025.md) formats
    - Write `file` data to local filesystem
    - Determine basic info about `file` data (size, mime-type, extension, etc)
    - Save `file` info to `stamps` table
    - Replace `description` field value with `STAMP` text to indicate description points to record in `stamps` table
    - Save `issuances` data
    - Save `messages` data

2. Create `stamps` table which includes the following data :
    - `tx_hash` - Transaction hash of `stamp` transaction
    - `stamp_index` - Official `stamp` `file` number
    - `mime-type` - File MIME / Media Type (image/png, application/json, etc.)
    - `file-size` - Size of the file in bytes
    - `extension` - File extension (png, pdf, zip, etc.)
    - `hash` - Hash of the `stamp` `file` data

3. Add `stamp-filesystem` to [`fednode`](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/federatednode) stack
    - Create new 'STAMPS' configuration (optional component)
    - Add container with nginx webserver to serve out `stamp` `file` data


4. Update [`counterparty-lib`](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterparty-lib) API to support querying `stamps` via `get_{table}` requests.
