# Abstract

Establishes a new send message type geared towards batch processing to send multiple assets to multiple addresses.


# Motivation

* Simplify batch transactions
* Reduce transaction fees


# Rationale

Multiple transactions are wasteful when the sender already knows who are the recipients and how much of each asset each one needs to receive. This functionality is especially useful for sites dealing with a group of asset to asset exchanges. MPMA addresses this issue by creating a lookup table for addresses and grouping sends by type of asset sent. Amounts are compressed with a simple RLE scheme which reduces the amount of information needed to express simple amounts by a compression ratio of up to 22:1 (with a worst case scenario of 100:101 inflation for truly random sent amounts).


# Definitions

    LUT
        A lookup table for addresses, used as a mean to compress information
        
    RLE
        Run-length Encoding, a compression technique used express multiple values grouped on a master-slave disposition.
        
    CoInt
        8 byte RLE integer encoded the following way: 1 bit marker for compressed or not compressed (0 means raw 8 byte integer, 1 means RLE encoded integer). 1 byte data, 2 bits number of times data is repeated.
        Following sample code decompresses a CoInt into a full 8 byte integer:
        
        `python
        `
        

# Overview

The main idea is to create a lookup table for addreses so they can be expressed by simple indexes, and then compress each amount sent with simple RLE.

# Specification

The message format is constructed in the following way:
 
LUT size|LUT address 0|...|LUT address N|Asset 0 Name|# addrs asset 0|LUT Idx 0|...|LUT Idx N|...|Asset M Name| needs finishing
--------|-------------|---|-------------|------------|---------------|---------|---|---------|---|------------|----
 16 Bits|   25 bytes  |...|   25 bytes  |   CoInt    |    1-16 bits  |1-16 bits|...|1-16 bits|...|    CoInt   |
