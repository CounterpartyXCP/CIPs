## CIP Implementation Bounties ##

Bounties raised from the Counterparty community can be a useful tool to promote implementation of specific CIPs, via raising the funds sometimes necessary to compensate development time. To help facilitate this, the Counterparty Foundation may appoint one or more CIP Custodians, who shall be in charge of handling funds for currently open CIP bounty efforts. CIP custodians shall serve for an indeterminate amount of time, and may be freely appointed and removed by the Counterparty Foundation members via a majority vote. Imposed limitations are as follows:

* An individual serving as a CIP custodian may not serve as a Counterparty Foundation board member at the same time.
* An individual may not serve as both a CIP author and CIP custodian for any specific proposal.

Once a CIP is in the draft stage, the CIP's author may choose to contact a CIP custodian, who will provision a donation address for that bounty under the sole control of the CIP custodian. A separate private key/address shall be used to handle the funds for each bounty independently. If multiple CIP custodians are serving, they may choose to jointly secure funds for a specific bounty via a multi-signature scheme, but such a scheme is not required. All funds gathered shall stay at the address to which they were sent while under the control of a CIP custodian.

Before a CIP custodian may provision a donation address for a specific CIP, that CIP must be written to include a section entitled "Milestones", which shall include the following:

* The fundraising goal, being a total amount (expressed in BTC, XCP or USD) that must be raised in order to consider fundraising for the CIP complete. (Contributions over and above this amount will be refunded to their senders by the CIP custodian.)  
* One or more discrete milestones. For each, sufficiently detailed and actionable criteria which must be met in order to consider the milestone completed should be listed.
* Each milestone must also list a certain percentage figure, which will be the percentage of the total funds raised that will be disbursed by the CIP custodian upon the listed criteria being satisfied. All percentages must add up to 100%, and any "kickoff" milestone present, where funds are awarded without any actual work being done yet, may not exceed 10%.

Once produced, the donation address will be provided back to the CIP author over a pubic, auditable medium such as the Counterparty forums. The CIP author shall then include it in the "Milestones" section of the CIP draft, and may then commence the fundraising necessary to attract development talent to implement the CIP for an amount up to the listed fundraising goal. Once an interested developer is found, that developer's name should also be listed in the CIP as the individual (or individuals) implementing it. The CIP custodian shall not serve as a developer for any CIP for which he or she has control (or partial control) of the funds.

The CIP custodian is only obligated to disburse funds once the CIP is approved *and* the appropriate milestone(s) are completed. If either is not the case, no funds will be disbursed. If the CIP is rejected or deferred, the CIP author may choose to ask the CIP custodian to refund the raised funds to the community. In this event, the CIP custodian will send the funds back to each address that sent them, minus any applicable transaction fees. (For this reason, individuals should never donate from an exchange address, and should only donate from an address they control.)

The decision as to whether a milestone is reached shall be the sole decision of the Counterparty project maintainers (i.e. individuals that have commit access to the [counterparty-lib]( https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterparty-lib) repository). Normally, a single project maintainer may approve a milestone being complete. However, if there is disagreement among project maintainers as to the completion of a specific milestone, such a disagreement must be resolved via a majority (51%) of project maintainers approving the completion of the milestone.

In the event of fraud or sufficient controversy surrounding a CIP or CIP bounty, a project maintainer or the Counterparty Foundation board (via a majority vote) may compel the CIP custodian to refund undisbursed funds.
