# Abstract

Establishes a new send message type with three distinct features...  

* Eliminate the receiving address dust output by encoding the receiving address in the Counterparty message data
* Utilizes a single byte message ID (see CIP11)
* User specified Memo (optional)


# Motivation

To additional functionality to an asset send while at the same time making asset sends cheaper and more efficient.

Enhanced sends have a smaller transaction size, eliminate dust outputs, and add a memo that enables greater efficiency and lower tx fees for exchange operators.


# Rationale

An asset send transaction currently requires a P2PKH output to the receiver of an asset.  This is in addition to the message data output (encoded in OP_RETURN).  The additional output is an unnecessary burden that, on average, is *five times* more expensive to spend than it's worth (using an avg fee of 200 sat/byte and 148 bytes per tx input).  At a bitcoin price of $1200, that's a cost of $0.37 (29600 sat) to spend a $0.07 (5430 sat) dust output!

The primary use case for a memo field is to identify transactions to merchants and exchanges.  This reduces the cost associated with accepting or listing XCP and Counterparty assets.


# Definitions

Memo

        A 34-byte sender specified field stored in an asset send message
        

# Overview

An Enhanced Asset Send adds the following two features to a traditional Asset Send transaction...


### Encoding Receiving Address in Message Data

A standard Bitcoin/Counterparty Base58 receiving address can be binary encoded and stored as an element within a send message at a size of 21 bytes after removing the checksum. 


### Memo 

The Memo is usually used to identify transactions to merchants and exchanges: when a single public address is used for incoming transactions, the Memo is especially useful to tie incoming payments with user accounts. 


# Specification

The enhanced send, detailed in this proposal, utilizes the existing asset send message data structure with some additional elements: a single byte message ID (see CIP11), receiving address and memo.  

*   New Message ID: ````0x02````
*   Receiving Address (21 bytes): bitcoin public key hash, no checksum. 
*   Memo: The Memo is an arbitrary hex or text string to allow versatility for end users and developers.  The encoded string must be no more than 34 bytes.
*   Message Structure: CNTRPRTY + Message ID + Asset Name + Asset Qty + 21 bytes of Receiving network prefix and public key hash + Memo
*   Total Message Data max size, 80 bytes


#### Example
```
434e545250525459|02|000000000004fadf|000000174876e800|0026343166625c7475f01e48b5ede8c0252e051a8b|ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff

8 + 1 + 8 + 8 + 21 + 34 = 80
```


# API Changes

### create_send

`create_send` adds these new parameters

* **memo** (string): The memo field data
* **memo_is_hex** (boolean): If set and true, then interpret the memo field as hexadecimal encoded data.  Defaults to `false`.
* **use_enhanced_send** (boolean): If set and false, then use the old-style send with regular bitcoin dust.  Defaults to `true`.

### get_sends

`get_sends` returns 2 additional fields

* **memo_hex** (string): The memo field as a hexadecimal encoded data
* **memo** (string): The memo field as a utf-8 encoded string

### search by memo

When searching for a send in the database, you may filter by providing a `memo` or `memo_hex` field as a search filter.  If filtering by `memo_hex`, then the field value is interpreted as a hexadecimal value.  If filtering by `memo`, then the field value is interpreted as a utf-8 encoded string.  Only exact matches are allowed when filtering by memo.
