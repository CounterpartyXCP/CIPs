# Abstract

Establishes a new send message type with two distinct features...  

* Eliminate the receiving address dust output by encoding the receiving address in the Counterparty message data.  
* User specified Payment ID (optional)


# Motivation

To additional functionality to an asset send while at the same time making asset sends cheaper and more efficient.

Enhanced sends have a smaller transaction size, eliminate dust outputs, and add a payment ID that enables greater efficiency and lower tx fees for exchange operators.


# Rationale

Asset send messages use only 28 bytes of data.  There are 54 bytes available to increase send efficiency (by including the receiving address) and add functionality (a 30-byte Payment ID).


# Definitions

Payment ID

        A 30-byte sender specified identifier included as part of an asset send message
        

# Overview

An Enhanced Asset Send adds the following two features to a traditional Asset Send transaction...

### Encoding Receiving Address in Message Data

An asset send transaction currently requires a P2PKH output to the receiver of an asset.  This is in addition to the message data output (encoded in OP_RETURN).  The additional output is an unnecessary burden that, on average, is *five times* more expensive to spend than it's worth (using an avg fee of 200 sat/byte and 148 bytes per tx input).  At a bitcoin price of $1200, that's a cost of $0.37 (29600 sat) to spend a $0.07 (5430 sat) dust output!

### Payment ID 

The Payment ID is usually used to identify transactions to merchants and exchanges: when a single public address is used for incoming transactions, the Payment ID is especially useful to tie incoming payments with user accounts. 


# Specification

The enhanced send, detailed in this proposal, utilizes the existing asset send message data structure but and adds a  receiving address and payment ID.  The total enhanced send message data size is 80 bytes to allow for storage within an OP_RETURN output.

*   New Message Type (ID=2)
*   Message Structure (CNTRPRTY + Message ID + Asset Name + Asset Qty + Receiving Address + Payment ID)
*   Receiving Address, 21 bytes (Base58->Hex, no checksum). 
    For converting address from Base58->Hex and vice versa, see http://lenschulwitz.com/base58
*   Payment ID, 30 bytes (Hex) preceded by a 1 byte Payment ID length value. The Payment ID to be stored as a hex string to allow versatility for end users and developers.
*   Total Message Data size, 80 bytes


#### Example
```
434e545250525459|00000002|000000000004fadf|000000174876e800|051a8b0026343166625c7475f01e48b5ede8c0252e|1effffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
