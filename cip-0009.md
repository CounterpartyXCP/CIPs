# Abstract

Establishes a new send message type with two distinct features...  

* Eliminate the receiving address dust output by encoding the receiving address in the Counterparty message data.  
* User specified Memo (optional)


# Motivation

To additional functionality to an asset send while at the same time making asset sends cheaper and more efficient.

Enhanced sends have a smaller transaction size, eliminate dust outputs, and add a payment ID that enables greater efficiency and lower tx fees for exchange operators.


# Rationale

Asset send messages use only 28 bytes of data.  There are 52 bytes available to increase send efficiency (by including the receiving address), add functionality (a 30-byte Memo) and encode the Counterparty message data within an OP_RETURN output.


# Definitions

Memo

        A 30-byte sender specified identifier included as part of an asset send message
        

# Overview

An Enhanced Asset Send adds the following two features to a traditional Asset Send transaction...

### Encoding Receiving Address in Message Data

An asset send transaction currently requires a P2PKH output to the receiver of an asset.  This is in addition to the message data output (encoded in OP_RETURN).  The additional output is an unnecessary burden that, on average, is *five times* more expensive to spend than it's worth (using an avg fee of 200 sat/byte and 148 bytes per tx input).  At a bitcoin price of $1200, that's a cost of $0.37 (29600 sat) to spend a $0.07 (5430 sat) dust output!

### Memo 

The Memo is usually used to identify transactions to merchants and exchanges: when a single public address is used for incoming transactions, the Memo is especially useful to tie incoming payments with user accounts. 


# Specification

The enhanced send, detailed in this proposal, utilizes the existing asset send message data structure with two additional elements: a receiving address and a Memo.  The total enhanced send message data size is 80 bytes to allow for storage within an OP_RETURN output.

*   New Message Type (ID=2)
*   Message Structure (CNTRPRTY + Message ID + Format flags + Memo + Asset Name + Asset Qty + Receiving Address)
*   Format flags (1 byte) (Multisend Format + Memo Length)
    ```
    000|11110
     |    └-- Memo Length (0 - 30)
     └--- Multisend format (0 is a single send)
    ```

    * Multisend format: This is reserved for use in a future CIP.  0 indicates a single send.
    * Memo length: Specifies the length of the memo field.

*   Memo: The Memo is an arbitrary hex or text string to allow versatility for end users and developers.  The encoded string must be no more than 30 bytes.
*   Receiving Address, 21 bytes (Base58->Hex, no checksum). 
    For converting address from Base58->Hex and vice versa, see http://lenschulwitz.com/base58
*   Total Message Data max size, 80 bytes


#### Example
```
434e545250525459|00000002|1e|ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff|000000000004fadf|000000174876e800|051a8b0026343166625c7475f01e48b5ede8c0252e
```


# API Changes

### create_send

`create_send` adds these new parameters

* **memo** (string): The memo field data
* **memo_is_hex** (boolean): If set and true, then interpret the memo field as hexadecimal encoded data.  Defaults to `false`.
* **use_enhanced_send** (boolean): If set and false, then use the old-style send with regular bitcoin dust.  Defaults to `true`.

### get_sends

`get_sends` returns 2 additional fields

* **memo_hex** (string): The memo field as a hexadecimal encoded data
* **memo** (string): The memo field as a utf-8 encoded string

### search by memo

When searching for a send in the database, you may filter by providing a `memo` or `memo_hex` field as a search filter.  If filtering by `memo_hex`, then the field value is interpreted as a hexadecimal value.  If filtering by `memo`, then the field value is interpreted as a utf-8 encoded string.  Only exact matches are allowed when filtering by memo.
