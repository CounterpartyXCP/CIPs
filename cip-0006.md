## Abstract ##

With chaining 2 transactions together we can embed data in the scriptSigs of P2SH outputs.


## Motivation ##

Counterparty currently has the following data encoding schemes:
 - `opreturn` the best solution, doesn't pollute the UTXO set, is the cheapest, but limited to a maximum 80 bytes
 - `multisig` the 2nd best solution, only temporarly pollutes the UTXO set, has no upper limit
 - `pubkeyhash` the worst solution, permanently pollutes the UTXO set, but also has no upper limit

For (literally) 99% of Counterparty transactions `opreturn` is enough (though some people forcefully use multisig encoding).
Previously for the rest we'd fall back to using `multisig` encoding since it has no real drawbacks.

Unfortunately since Bitcoin Core v0.12.1 there's a DoS protection (called `bytespersigop`) that has essentially made bare multisig non-standard.

So we need an alternative for larger amounts of data and we want to avoid `pubkeyhash` encoding because it pollutes the UTXO set too much.

With the EVM coming there will also be more transactions with larger amounts of data, so we need this more than ever!


## Rationale ##

It's possible to embed data in P2SH redeemScripts by doing 2 transactions
where the first one sets up P2SH outputs with redeemScripts that allow us to put the data in the scriptSig of the spending transaction.

With this method we can easily put in a lot more data than the other methods, does not polute the UTXO set
and signature data can be pruned by Bitcoin nodes that wish to do so.

The original proof of concept, by Peter Todd, of this can be found here: https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib/blob/master/examples/publish-text.py


## Specification ##

### The Basics
This process requires 2 transactions, the first to setup 1 or more P2SH outputs and then the second spending the P2SH outputs and placing the data we wish to embed in the `scriptSig`.

##### The Redeem Script
The data is split chunks of max X size, then for each chunk we create a `redeemScript` as follows:

```
redeemScript = {{ data }} OP_HASH160 {{ hash160(data) }} OP_EQUALVERIFY {{ pubkey }} OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY {{ n }} OP_DROP OP_DEPTH 0 OP_EQUAL
```

dissecting this into pieces we have:

```
{{ data }} OP_HASH160 {{ hash160(data) }} OP_EQUALVERIFY
```
this is where we place the data and the `OP_HASH160 {{ hash160(data) }} OP_EQUALVERIFY` ensure the data can't be changed.

```
{{ pubkey }} OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY
```
this ensures the output needs to be signed by the owner, this can be replaced by other scripts such as a multisig or CLTV or similar things that were previously already put into P2SH outputs.

```
{{ n }} OP_DROP
```
`n` is an incrementing number to ensure that each output is unique even when the data chunks aren't.


```
OP_DEPTH 0 OP_EQUAL
```
this prevents scriptSig malleability.

##### The Output Script
The output script placed in the first transaction is then:
```
ouputScript = OP_HASH160 {{ hash160([redeemScript]) }} OP_EQUALVERIFY
```

### The real deal
Below we'll describe how a Counterparty `send` would look.

##### Transaction 1

###### Inputs
 - 1 + n UTXOs from the `source` address to have enough BTC to pay the fees for both the first and the second transaction.

###### Outputs
 - 1 output to `source` with enough value to pay the fee for the second transaction.
 - 1 + n P2SH outputs following the above method with `DUST` value.
 - 1 change output to send any excess BTC back to `source` (optional; but in practice always there)

##### Transaction 2

###### Inputs
 - 1 input spending the `source` output from Transaction 1
 - 1 + n inputs spending the P2SH outputs, including the data in the `scriptSig`

###### Outputs
 - 1 output to specify the destination of the Counterparty transaction (in some types of transactions this is omitted) with `DUST` value.
 - 1 `opreturn` output encoding the data `'CNTRPTY' + 'P2SH'` to signal that the data is found in the P2SH inputs, with 0 value.

###### Fees & Coin Selection
The first transaction has send enough BTC to the second transaction so the second transaction can pay for it's own fee without having to add extra inputs.
So we calculate the value of the `source` output in the first transaction to be:
```
estimated_size_of_tx2 = 10  # base size of  TX
estimated_size_of_tx2 += 181  # for source input
estimated_size_of_tx2 += 29 * count(destination_outputs)  # for destination outputs
estimated_size_of_tx2 += sizeof(data)  # for the data
estimated_size_of_tx2 += count(data_p2sh_outputs) * (181 + 9)  # for the overhead of each data output being spend
estimated_fee_for_tx2 = (estimated_size_of_tx2 / 1000) * fee_per_kb
source_output_value = count(data_p2sh_outputs) * DUST + count(destination_outputs) * DUST + estimated_fee_for_tx2
```

This means the amount of BTC to require when doing coinselection is:
```
estimated_size_of_tx1_without_inputs = 10  # base size of a TX
estimated_size_of_tx1_without_inputs += 29  # for source output
estimated_size_of_tx1_without_inputs += count(data_p2sh_outputs) * 29  # for P2SH data outputs

inputs = []
for UTXO in coinselection:
   inputs.append(UTXO)
   estimated_size_of_tx1 = estimated_size_of_tx1_without_inputs + count(inputs) * 181
   estimated_fee_for_tx1 = (estimated_size_of_tx1 / 1000) * fee_per_kb

   if sum(inputs) >= estimated_fee_for_tx1 + estimated_fee_for_tx2 + source_output_value + count(data_p2sh_outputs) * DUST:
       break
```

### The Counterparty API
In practice this means the `create_*` API calls will have to start returning a list of 1 or more transactions which the client signs and broadcasts,
so clients need to adapt to this new style and always assume they need to sign and broadcast N transactions.

Pre-segwit we won't be able to have the second transaction spend from the first transaction until the first transaction has been signed,
this means the client actually needs to do 2 API calls, where the second has the txId of the signed first transaction as param.

Once we can use segwit this problem is gone! However not all clients will straight away be able to sign segwit transactions (requires upgrades of the libraries they use).

Because of this being quite a hassle we propose to have 2 node configs / API params to control all of this: `segwit` and `old_style_api`.

##### `old_style_api`
When `old_style_api = True` the API will continue to function as normal, returning a single transaction, as string.

Once `old_style_api = False` the API will (across all `create_*` transactions) return a list of 1+ transactions (even when it's just 1).

While `old_style_api = True` P2SH encoding will not be used unless explcitily set (so - the default - `encoding=auto` will not use P2SH encoding).

##### `segwit`
When `segwit = False` the first API call will return `[tx_hex, None]` signalling that it needs a second call with `p2sh_pretx_txid` added as param,
which should be the txId of the signed first transaction.
The second API call will then return `[None, tx_hex]`.

When `segwit = True` the API call will return `[tx_hex, tx_hex]` and will no longer require a second API call.

##### EVM Transactions
Because the nature of EVM transactions being large(r) amounts of data,
the EVM API calls (`create_publish` and `create_broadcast`) will require `old_style_api == False`.


### Child pays for Parent
The current scheme ensures both transactions pay fee for their own size, in the (near) future when the 'Child pays for Parent' functionality
that has been added to Bitcoin Core is widely adopted we can change this so that the second transaction pays a larger portion of the total fee (still needs to pay enough to be relayed).

This will ensure that the first transaction is never mined without the second transaction.


## Backwards Compatibility ##

This is a new encoding that will be completely unrecognised by older clients, any clients who don't upgrade would loose consensus with the nodes that did upgrade.
It also affects how the Counterparty API works (see above).
