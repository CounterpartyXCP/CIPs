## Abstract ##

Any user should be able to mark an address under their control as memo-required. The protocol should track this memo requirement and prevent any sends to the address without a memo.

## Motivation ##

To lessen end user support costs by enforcing a memo requirement at the protocol level.

## Rationale ##

CIP9 allows for specifying a memo in a send transaction, which can reduce the FEES cost for exchanges by allowing customers to make deposits directly to an exchange hot-wallet. The data in the 'memo' field is used to associate a transaction with a specific customer, and removes the requirement that each customer have their own deposit address. However, there is still a non-trivial SUPPORT cost associated with tracking down customer deposits _without_ a memo.

By allowing an exchange to mark their address as memo-required, and rejecting sends without a memo, they are able to reduce their support costs.

Enforcing a memo requirement at the protocol level also has the added benefit that it can discourage predatory behavior by exchanges, such as allowing sends without a memo, and ignoring any support requests by customers who made a deposit _without_ a memo. 

## Specification ##

There will be a 'special' broadcast message that is used to set address options; `OPTIONS <INTEGER>`.


#### OPTIONS
```OPTIONS <INTEGER>```
 - `INTEGER`: a bitwise operation that identifies the desired options

The REQUIRE_MEMO flag (bit one) may be turned on or off as many times as desired with successive OPTIONS broadcast messages.

#### `LOCK`ed broadcast feed
Counterparty has a feature to broadcast the text `LOCK` to prevent any further broadcasts from that address ever being considered valid.
Any `OPTIONS` messages broadcast from an address with a `LOCK`ed broadcast feed will be ignored.

## Changes ##

### Database 
 
1. Create `addresses` table with the following definition:
```
CREATE TABLE addresses (
    address TEXT UNIQUE,    -- address
    options INTEGER         -- bitwise address flags (the REQUIRE_MEMO option is represented by the first bit)
);
 ```

Note: The maximum INTEGER stored in sqlite is 64 bits


### Sends

1. When validating a send attempt (send.validate):
   - Check if destination address requires memo
   - Check if transaction has a memo included

### Broadcasts

1. When parsing a broadcast (broadcast.parse)
   - Check for `OPTIONS <INTEGER>` as the broadcast text
   - Verify that address is not LOCKed by checking for previous LOCK broadcast
   - If INTEGER is greater than than the maximum flag used, then the OPTIONS broadcast will be ignored. As of CIP 12, only 1 or 0 are accepted.
   - Create/Update record in `addresses` table and set OPTIONS
